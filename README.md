# used a data- attribute on the search button in the nav bar.
# for extra credit, I used the CSS transitions property with a 3 second duration on the first <p> tag to gradually change the font color to red.
# All code and help used here have come either from javascript.info or MDN web docs, bootstrap documentation, or lecture.
