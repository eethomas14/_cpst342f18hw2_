## Conditions:

* Follow all instructions and naming conventions for full credit.
* You may work with a classmate on this assignment (all parts or nothing).

## Objective 1 (185 pts)

### Summary:
You will be updating your web page from unit 2 to add some JS integration.
  
### Requirements for any credit

* Update your Heroku app (you can choose a new URL if you like, but no requirement to do so) to add the below components to it. You can either add a new page or make these updates to an existing page, but put them all on one page for me to grade.
* If copying and code from the web, remember to fully cite your sources AND to document the code with comments to explain _why_ AND _how_ it is working for any credit (0 pts per relevant prompt if you do not fully cite!).
* Note any extra credit opportunities you have completed in your README if you wish to get credit for them.
* Use **ES6** to complete the the below tasks.

### Tasks/Rubric
1. (20 pts) Use at least 1 HTML `data-` attribute and hook into it with JavaScript to affect the DOM in some manner. State in your README which component this is and how it is used.
1. (20 pts) Create some sort of button or link to toggle the display of any web component on your application. (+5 points if you use CSS transitions)
1. (25 pts) Create an HTML form on your application using at least 5 different HTML5 input types (see (here for help)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input]). Make at least 2 of them `required`.
1. (10 pts) Add basic styling to your form. If you're using Bootstrap, see <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/forms/> 
1. (50 pts) Capture the form submission and save the contents `localStorage`. **Save each field (at least 5 fields!) as their own key/value pair in the `localStorage` `Map`!** Do not serialize the entire submission and save it all as one value to `localStorage`.
1. (50 pts) Upon page load AND upon form submission, on the same page as your form, update the DOM to display the most recent submission data. That is, you should print the contents of the submission in an organized manner to the web page.
1. (10 pts) Add basic styling to your form submission display.
1. (30 pts) Give the user the ability to change the background color of the web page by using the input type `color` picker: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/color>. Use JS and events to integrate with this to update the background color CSS of the `<body>` element.
